# odin-recipes

Welcome!
This project is a basic recipe website with the aim of cultivating knowledge of HTML syntax, lists, links, and images in its design.
Select a dish in the home page to be redirected to that dish's recipe page.
Each recipe page contains an image of the dish, a list of ingredients, and instructions on how to prepare the dish.
